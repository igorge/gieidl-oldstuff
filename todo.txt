[HIG] named collection's insert method must have validator parameter
[LOW] Fix typo in semantic.nodes.fucntion.interfaces.h.
[LOW] Implemnet cv_qualifiers like function specifiers (as attributes).
[LOW] Implement for pointer node: dependent symbols should be fine with forward only decl.
[LOW] Implement node categories (to include node types) and  modify late_bound to accept category for accepted node for late resolution
[HIG] Implement 'smart ' inteface golder => own if late_bound and own proxy ifobject in a tree
[LOW] Deal with this: struct a{}; struct outer{ struct b:a{}; struct a{}; };
[LOW] Seperate visitor_i from its default implementation.
[MED] Store line information in attribute repository.
[LOW] Implement aggregate tag name to be dumped.
[LOW] Deprecate list_i (and relatives) for good.

DONE
[MED] Implement symbol_lookup_i (and concept)
[HIG] Implemnet dependable symbols (forwards) resolution.
[WISH] Implement symbol binding as plugable subsystem (something like backends).
[LOW] Implement visitor for tree nodes.
[CRI] Implement required_symbols_i in order to implement (forwards) resolution.
[CRI] Think of avoiding recursion (remeber somewhere nodes we are visiting now?)
[LOW][DROPPED] replace plain tuple and differerenc search result_t with node_info_t type.
[LOW] Dump access when inheritting.
[HIG] Implement accees to be dumped for aggregate members.
[LOW] Use plain std::list instead of list_i for fq_id.
